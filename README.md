# HackNC 2022 - Game Dev Workshop
A videogame where the player rotates a spaceship to avoid collisions. Developed by <a href="https://github.com/kadirlofca">Kadir Lofca</a> using Godot Engine and visual scripting as a workshop project for HackNC 2022. 



# Setup 


**Setting Up Godot Engine**

Open the <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/releases/tag/3.4.4-stable">Godot v3.4.4 page</a>. Under "Assets", find the folder for your operating system (Windows, MacOS or OSX, Linux, etc). Download the folder and extract it to a location of your choice. In the extracted folder, you will find an executable that will run the engine.

**Downloading The Game Assets**

In the <a href="https://github.com/kadirlofca/hacknc22-godotgame">repository page</a> click "Download ZIP" from the dropdown menu under the green "Code" button. This will download the repository with all of its contents inside a zip folder. You can extract the files to a location of your choice. After the workshop, the final game project files will be uploaded to this repository.

# Creating A Fresh Godot Project

After dowloading Godot Engine, run the executable. The Godot interface will start. Here, you can manage your projects.

Click "New Project". Enter the name of your project and select a project path where the files will be stored. After you enter the name and path, select the renderer. For this project, we will be using OpenGL ES 2.0 as the renderer.

A new project will be created and the project window will open up. All coding and development will be done through this project window. At the left we have a hierarchical view of the scene objects (no objects exist initially). Below that (bottom left) there is the file heirarchy that displays all files inside the project folder. At the right we have an inspector where the properties of the focused object can be viewed from. In the middle we have the scene view.
